ColorMatch Hue Puzzle is a game developed by Rolf Genree L. Garces as his final project for CMSC 122: Data Structures and Algorithm I.
This is inspired by Color Puzzle and all the level configuration are taken from the game.
This game features dynamic grid challenges with varied grid sizes and randomized tile placements at each level. 
Each level also includes some immovable, correctly placed tiles to guide players. 
Unlike similar games, ColorMatch Hue Puzzle offers a hint system with optional, 
limited clues and the option to view the correct tile arrangement for additional support. 
The game also tracks the userâ€™s moves, encouraging strategic planning to minimize steps.
